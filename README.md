# epub-to-image

When I tried to extract images from an EPUB, I faced the issue of having jumbled file names. Using this method, I can extract them in the correct order.

## How to use

```bash
epub_to_image.exe something.epub
```

with directory 

```bash
epub_to_image.exe something.epub -o output_dir
```
